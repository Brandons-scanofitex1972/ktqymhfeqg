Just—wow. Still trying to make sense of what just happened, man. I mean, Drop was like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a cat chase its own tail on a never-ending loop, and not realizing it’s actually a snake. The whole thing just twirled and twisted like the blue and pink cotton candy I spilled under the seat before losing track of it. A guy next to me smelled like onions, it’s wild. The colors were neon, and yet muted like someone forgot to pay the electric bill for the spectrum of vividness. 

The scenes where everything was silent felt like that one time in the 𝘭𝘪𝘣𝘳𝘢𝘳𝘺 when I dropped a stack of books — just all eyes on you. But then everything would BOOM, WHAM! right back to chaos like a slap to the back of your head you didn’t see coming. Man, the intensity.

> Someone, I think the director, just took a blender, tossed in some Dali, a teaspoon of Kubrick, and a splash of molasses, and said go! I could feel the joints in my back disagreeing with the discomfort but who cared, not while you’re glued in awe.

I think my popcorn fell in dramatic slow-motion — irony not lost considering the high-speed chase where the car flipped like some kind of kinetic origami. Remember? You asked to borrow, no, wait... 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ? You gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , if only for the scene where reality bubbles like boiling cheese on a forgotten fondue. Is a denial of gravity or common sense? I dunno. My brain is pudding.

It could be chaos described by a hyperactive child wielding crayons on a freshly painted wall—each scene a scribble harking back to the days when skies were lime green and dogs meowed. It leaves you with questions, like why is my foot asleep, and does this theater chair owe me an apology?

Why was that last act like trying to catch confetti in a hurricane? The dialogue! Oh the dialogue, like whispers in a crowded bazaar, some lines just floated away like unanchored boats. 

void nonSenseFunction() { int why = 42; char floating[] = hamster wheels; return false; }

Let's... talk in full sentences another time maybe.
